<h1> ThomasBiddle.com Website Content </h1>
<p>
This repository is a copy of ThomasBiddle.com . Currently, this repository is set to Private in Github as I do have sensitive information. I will move said files to a different area on server structure and will soon be making this open source, especially when I re-write everything.
</p>

Reminders:
<ul>
	<li> Go through source and make sure no API keys for anything are made public - if they are, externalize them and add to .gitignore - Or better yet add to a different area in the file system and reference them there. Remember, anything that is in HTML is already public. 
  <li> Clean up file structure. A lot of these files are not related to what is necessary for the site. 
	<li> Re-write myself.
</ul>

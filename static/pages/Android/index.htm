Over the past year I've had a growing interest the Android mobile platform and have been incredibly eager to dive into some projects with it. 
I've finally managed to find a bit of free time to start reading some material and getting my hands dirty with some fun projects! While I'm trying 
to force myself to read through the documentation in full before creating anything (I've found this saves me a lot of time in the long wrong), I 
couldn't help myself from testing out some ideas and going a bit off track.
</p>

<p>
While I still have a lot of self-assigned reading that I want to get through, I've developed two near-completely functional apps. My first one is 
for my sister's business, <a href="http://www.puppywood.com">Puppywood Pet Resort</a>, and the second is for my brother-in-law's web design company, 
<a href="http://www.vezign.com">Vezign</a>. I still have a lot of ideas that I want to play with; and a lot more to learn before releasing the apps in full, 
however; I can provide screenshots for now - and will post the full source code shortly!
</p>

<p>
Jumping into the Android development scene will be a never-ending process; and I find that to be a great as I am having an absolute blast learning 
about all the new things on the platform! I really hope that I can put my newly found skills to use in the future, maybe even in a career position (Hint hint if you're a hiring ;)).

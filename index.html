          I believe life experiences are what make us all unique. In order to truly live we must all branch out, try new things, and make mistakes. Each of us are on this planet are given the same amount of time every day, but what we do with that time is what makes us who we are; the lives we touch, the actions we take, and the words we speak are all we have to make a mark on this world. I want to truly make my existence count.

          I try to be the kind of person who does the things that people talk and think about, but don't take action on. There should never be something holding you back from what you want to do, so I strive to break down all barriers.

          Currently I am working on <a href='http://www.groomguru.io'>GroomGuru</a> - a modern administrative software solution for pet groomers! This was
          launched in 2016 and I am currently growing the user base.
          <br><br>
          As previous projects - I have founded VPSInfinity and co-foudned MCLayer; both of which were VPS hosting companies catering to separate niche online gaming communities. These were moderately successful, especially given I launched them while I was quite young. VPSInfinity I closed down as the market dwindled and MCLayer I sold my share in to pursue other projects.
